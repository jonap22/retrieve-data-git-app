# Retrieving data from GitHub public API
This is my Pet Project #4 for Stack Builders organization.

# Pet Project

Create a small application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS that retrieves data from Github's Stack Builders organization (https://github.com/stackbuilders). For this, you'll use Github's public API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-organization-repositories.

# The application shows:

1. Repositories with more than 5 stars
2. Last 5 updated repositories
3. Sum of all repository stars

# Considerations:

- Each functionality can be a function
- Try to make pure functions wherever possible.
- Include unit tests and test coverage
- Unit tests may not connect to GitHub, but use a fixture with preprocessed data
